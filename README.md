Fractal Generator is a program dedicated to the visualization of Julia fractals in C++ using OpenGL.
The application displays beautiful Julia fractals in real time. The selection of fractals is random, although an algorithm ensures that only visually interesting ones are chosen.
The selection and generation of fractals are highly optimized, using multithreading and GPU computation via OpenGL.
The program offers dynamic animation of Julia fractals by interpolating them using BÃ©zier curves.
